Replex is a novel concept that can be applied to any distributed database. We
introduce the data replication unit that we call a replex, which combines
replication and indexing. We then fundamentally change the replication paradigm
by replicating data to replexes, as opposed to exact data replicas. In doing
so, distributed databases can greatly reduce the overheads of supporting
secondary indexes, which are crucial to supporting rich functionality.

An open source [implementation](https://github.com/CorfuDB/CorfuDB) of Replex can be found integrated into the Corfu
database.
