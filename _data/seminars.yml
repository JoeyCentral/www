  title: "Sandpaper: Mitigating performance interference in CDN edge proxies"
  abstract: >
          Modern content delivery networks (CDNs) allow their customers (i.e.,
          operators of web services) to customize the processing of requests
          destined for their services by uploading and executing code at the
          edges of the CDN's network. To achieve scale, CDNs have forgone
          heavyweight virtualization techniques. Instead, all requests often
          execute within the same OS or even process. However, performance
          interference may arise when these requests have differing demands on
          multiple system resources. In this paper, we study the sources of
          performance interference based on workloads from real customers,
          identify the lack of multi-resource fairness as the culprit, and show
          that existing schedulers available in commodity OSes are
          insufficient.  

          We then design Sandpaper, a new and practical multi-resource request scheduler
          for mitigating performance interference in CDN edge-computing environments.
          Sandpaper enforces fairness despite sitting within the application runtime and
          running atop the OS's underlying resource schedulers. By leveraging key
          insights about the differences between theoretical system models and real
          systems, Sandpaper bridges the fundamental trade-off between resource
          utilization and multi-resource fairness that plagues existing schedulers. We
          implement a prototype of Sandpaper and demonstrate its effectiveness in
          mitigating performance interference. We further show that Sandpaper achieves
          high resource utilization with little performance overhead.
