            is a Professor in Princeton’s Computer Science Department, where he
            has been since 2007.  Prior to that, he received a Ph.D. from NYU’s
            Courant Insitute, during which he spent two years at Stanford
            University, and S.B. and M.Eng. degrees from MIT.  Mike’s research
            interests are in distributed systems, security, and networking,
            broadly defined.  He used to enjoy climbing, hiking, and
            mountaineering in his spare time, although this little thing called
            work keeps getting in the way lately.

           is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton
           University. His research interests include the distributed systems
           and networking problems that underlie the architecture of
           large-scale Web sites, cloud computing, and big data. He received
           his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 2013, spend the next year as
           a Postdoctoral Researcher at Facebook, and spent 3 years as an
           Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of
           Southern California before returning to Princeton.

            is a sixth-year Ph.D. student. Previously, he
            received an M.Eng. and B.S. degree from MIT, where he worked with
            Barbara Liskov on information-flow control. He is interested in
            security and distributed systems, and has worked on untrusted cloud
            services (Frientegrity and CONIKS) and least privilege web services
            (Passe). He is currently investigating cost-aware caching
            architectures for multi-tiered datacenter services.
